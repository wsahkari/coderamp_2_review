      <h2>Tasks:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>You'll have to apply the styles for the css_review page. There is already a stylesheet created for this file! Link the home.css file to this html file and things will become easier to read.</li>
        <li>Add your name and your partner's name as h3 elements inside of the header along with the other header content.</li>
        <li>The other review pages all have a nav bar that allows us to click between pages. Add one to this page that allows us to click between pages from here. Don't forget to make a link for home like the other pages have, but home should be the dead link for this page.</li>
        <li>Next add an unordered list with your three favorite words as list elements to the footer.</li>
        <li>Create another div and give it the id of my_div. This should go inside of the main div.</li>
        <li>Inside of my_div, add a paragraph tag with a couple of sentences of your choosing.</li>
        <li>Last use the link you created to go over to the css review!</li>
